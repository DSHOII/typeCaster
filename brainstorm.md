### Initial idea

typeCaster is a strategic magic battle game where you play a sorcerer/witch/wizard/warlord.

The idea so far is purely based on a new and challenging way of casting spells.

What is special about typeCaster is a focus on the conjuring phase of doing magic.

The conjuring phase will be realtime with many possibilities for tweeking, personalizing and manipulating both offensive and defensive spells.

In some way doing magic will be like writing code with the possibilty of looping, nesting and branching spells.

What makes a good player is skill, training and patience. The game will be hard to master.

As your in-game character rises in level, you will be able to construct harder spells and get more information on what your opponent is doing.

Victory in battle will be decided by creativity, the ability to counter your opponent and clever use of ressources.
